This file contains the class Code, which is used to create the secretCode,
check totally correct digits, and check partially correct digits.
The file utilizes copy vectors to make already checked values "inaccessible".
File is passed the user guess, size of desired code, and range of digits.
Returns the secretCode and number of correct and incorrect digits to main file.
